## Upgrading from version 1.3.x to 1.3.7
Version 1.3.7 is a drop-in replacement for earlier releases of 1.3.x with no data migration required.

## Upgrading from version 1.2.5 to 1.3.x

Version 1.3.x introduces changes to the data node configuration file.
Please update that configuration file to avoid any unnecessary downtime.
The steps below outline the upgrade process and include a list of the required configuration changes.

### Step 0: Back up your cluster before upgrading to version 1.3.
It is recommended to create a full backup of your cluster prior to executing the upgrade. If you are 
already have incremental backups being created as part of your standard operating procedures, you should 
trigger a final incremental backup before proceeding with the upgrade.
<dt>
Note that you need to ensure you have sufficient disk space before triggering the backup.
</dt>
The following command uses the [version 1.2 backup syntax](https://docs.influxdata.com/enterprise_influxdb/v1.2/guides/backup-and-restore/#syntax) 
to create an incremental backup of your cluster and it stores that backup in the current directory.

```
influxd-ctl backup .
```

Otherwise, you should create a full backup before proceeding. 
The following command uses the [backup syntax originally introduced in version 1.2](https://docs.influxdata.com/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/guides/backup-and-restore/#syntax) 
to create a full backup of your cluster and it stores that backup in the current directory. 

```
influxd-ctl backup -full .
```

### Step 1: Download the 1.3.7 packages

#### Meta node package download
**Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)**
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-meta_1.3.7-c1.3.7_amd64.deb
```

**RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)**
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-meta-1.3.7_c1.3.7.x86_64.rpm
```

#### Data node package download
**Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)**
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-data_1.3.7-c1.3.7_amd64.deb
```

**RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)**
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-data-1.3.7_c1.3.7.x86_64.rpm
```

### Step 2: Install the 1.3.7 packages

#### Meta node package Install

**Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)**
```
sudo dpkg -i influxdb-meta_1.3.7-c1.3.7_amd64.deb
```

**RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)**
```
sudo yum localinstall influxdb-meta-1.3.7_c1.3.7.x86_64.rpm
```

#### Data node package install

When you run the install command, your terminal asks if you'd like to keep your current configuration file or overwrite your current configuration file with the file for version 1.3.7.
Please keep your current configuration file by entering `N` or `O`;
we update the configuration file with the necessary changes for version 1.3.7 in step 3.

**Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)**
```
sudo dpkg -i influxdb-data_1.3.7-c1.3.7_amd64.deb
```

**RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)**
```
sudo yum localinstall influxdb-data-1.3.7_c1.3.7.x86_64.rpm
```

### Step 3: Update the data node configuration file

Add:

* [index-version = "inmem"](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#index-version-inmem) to the `[data]` section
* [wal-fsync-delay = "0s"](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#wal-fsync-delay-0s) to the `[data]` section
* [max-concurrent-compactions = 0](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#max-concurrent-compactions-0) to the `[data]` section
* [pool-max-idle-streams = 100](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#pool-max-idle-streams-100) to the `[cluster]` section
* [pool-max-idle-time = "1m0s"](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#pool-max-idle-time-1m0s) to the `[cluster]` section
* the [[anti-entropy]](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#anti-entropy) section:
```
[anti-entropy]
  enabled = true
  check-interval = "30s"
  max-fetch = 10
```

Remove:

* `max-remote-write-connections` from the `[cluster]` section
* the [[admin]](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#admin) section

Update:

* [cache-max-memory-size](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#cache-max-memory-size-1073741824) to `1073741824` in the `[data]` section

The new configuration options are set to their default settings.
Follow the links for more information about those options.

### Step 4: Restart the processes

#### Meta node restart
**sysvinit systems**
```
service influxdb-meta restart
```
**systemd systems**
```
sudo systemctl restart influxdb-meta
```

#### Data node Restart
**sysvinit systems**
```
service influxdb restart
```
**systemd systems**
```
sudo systemctl restart influxdb
```

### Step 5: Confirm the upgrade

Check your nodes' version numbers using the `influxd-ctl show` command.
The [`influxd-ctl` tool](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/features/cluster-commands/) is available on all meta nodes.

```
~# influxd-ctl show

Data Nodes

5	rk-upgrading-02:8088	1.3.7_c1.3.7
6	rk-upgrading-03:8088	1.3.7_c1.3.7

Meta Nodes

```
