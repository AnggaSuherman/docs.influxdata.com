# Concepts

The sections [Introduction](/tbd) and [Getting Started](/tbd) already presented the key concepts of **nodes** and **pipelines**.  Nodes represent process invocation units, that either take data as a batch, or in a point by point stream, and then alter that data, store that data, or trigger some other activity such as an alert.  Pipelines are simply logically organized chains of nodes.    

**Built on GO.** One important thing to keep in mind is that the TICKscript parser is built on GO.  Some arguments get passed from TICKscript into underlying GO API's, and some arguments accept GO structures or arguments that can be directly used to instantiate underlying GO structures, especially using the Duration type of the GO Time library.  

**Three Syntax domains.**  When working with TICKscript, three syntax domains will be encountered.  Overarching is the TICKscript syntax of the TICKscript file.  This is primarily composed of nodes chained together in pipelines.  Some nodes can be instantiated using strings representing InfluxQL statements.  So, InlfuxQL represents the second syntax domain that can be found.  Other nodes and methods use Lambda expressions, which represents the third syntax domain that will be met. The syntax between these domains, such as when dereferencing variables, can differ in important ways, and this can sometimes lead to confusion.

**Directed Acyclic Graphs.**  As mentioned in Getting Started, a pipeline is a Directed Acylic Graph (DAG). (For more information see [Wolfram](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AcyclicDigraph.html) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)). It contains a finite number of nodes (a.k.a. vertices) and edges.  Each edge is directed from one node to another.  No edge path can lead back to an earlier node in the path, which would result in a cycle or loop.  TICKscript paths (a.k.a pipelines and chains) typically begin with a processing mode definition node with an edge to a data set definition node and then pass their results down to filtering and processing nodes.

# TICKscript Syntax

TICKscript is case sensitive and uses Unicode. The TICKscript parser scans TICKscript code from top to bottom and left to right instantiating variables and nodes and then chaining or linking them together into pipelines as they are encountered.  When loading a TICKscript the parser does not check for compatibility between nodes.  Edges between incompatible nodes will result in log error messages when a task is first run.

## Code Representation

As the TICKScript parser is built on GO, source files should be encoded using UTF-8.  A script is broken into declarations and expressions that terminate with a newline character.  

Whitespace is used in declarations to separate variable names from operators and literal values.  It is also used before expressions to create indentations, which indicate the hierarchy of method calls.  This also helps to make the script more readable.  Whitespace can be used in method calls in much the same way it is used in GO.  That is, it can be used to separate and to name method call arguments.  Argument naming is especially common in passing lambda expressions.  

Comments can be created by using a pair of forward slashes "//" before the text.  Comment forward slashes can be preceded by whitespace and need not be the first characters of a newline. However comments should not follow after a declaration or expression.

Literals
--------

### Booleans

Boolean literals are the keywords `TRUE` and `FALSE`.
They are case sensitive.

### Numbers

Numbers are typed and are either a `float64` or an `int64`.
If the number contains a decimal it is considered to be a `float64` otherwise it is an `int64`.
All `float64` numbers are considered to be in base 10.
If an integer is prefixed with a `0` then it is considered a base 8 (octal) number, otherwise it is considered base 10.

Valid number literals:

* 1 -- int64
* 1.2 -- float64
* 5 -- int64
* 5.0 -- float64
* 0.42 -- float64
* 0400 -- octal int64


### Strings

There are two ways to write string literals:

1. Single quoted strings with backslash escaped single quotes.

    This string `'single \' quoted'` becomes the literal `single ' quoted`.

2. Triple single quoted strings with no escaping.

    This string `'''triple \' quoted'''` becomes the literal `triple \' quoted`.

### Durations

TICKscript supports durations literals.
They are of the form of InfluxQL duration literals.
See https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/spec/#literals

Duration literals specify a length of time.
An integer literal followed immediately (with no spaces) by a duration unit listed below is interpreted as a duration literal.

#### Duration unit definitions

 Units  | Meaning
--------|-----------------------------------------
 u or Âµ | microseconds (1 millionth of a second)
 ms     | milliseconds (1 thousandth of a second)
 s      | second
 m      | minute
 h      | hour
 d      | day
 w      | week

Statements
----------

A statement begins with an identifier and any number of chaining function calls.
The result of a statement can be assigned to a variable using the `var` keyword and assignment operator `=`.

Example:

```javascript
var errors = stream
    |from()
        .measurement('errors')
var requests = stream
    |from()
    .measurement('requests')
// Join the errors and requests stream
errors
    |join(requests)
        .as('errors', 'requests')
    |eval(lambda: "errors.value" / "requests.value")
```

Format
------

### Whitespace

Whitespace is ignored and can be used to format the code as you like.

Typically property methods are indented in from their calling node.
This way methods along the left edge are chaining methods.

For example:

```javascript
stream
    |eval(lambda: "views" + "errors")
        .as('total_views') // Increase indent for property method.
    |httpOut('example') // Decrease indent for chaining method.
```

### Comments

 Basic `//` style single line comments are supported.
